# `Mutlithread Image Compression In C++`
This project demonstrates real-time image and video compression using OpenCV in C++. It provides an interactive application that allows the user to choose between image or video compression, specify the compression level, and visualize the results.

# `Image Compression:`
- Allows the user to select an image file for compression.
- Supports multi-threading for efficient compression.
- Calculates the compression percentage and displays it on the compressed image.
- Displays the original and compressed images side by side.
- If you selected **image compression**:
- Enter the compression level as a percentage (e.g., 50 for 50% compression).
- The program will display the original and compressed images side by side, along with the compression percentage.

# `Notes`

- **Image Compression:**
- The input image file should be in a supported format (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
- Adjust the compression level to balance between image quality and file size.
